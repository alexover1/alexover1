# Hi, I'm Alex Overstreet

Welcome to my GitHub! Here you can check out some of the projects I've been working on.

I am currently a full-time student at the University of West Florida in Pensacola.
In my spare time, I enjoy working on projects such as compilers, video games, and
my personal website. Many of these can be found in my pinned repositories.

My passion is to create video games. I grew up making small games that I shared with
my family and my friends at school. You could say that I was obsessed with the details,
meaning I wanted to know *everything* about how video games worked. As I became a more
experienced programmer, I started to really want to drill down into exactly how the
computer was making my video games come to life. That's when I discovered the [Handmade
Hero project](https://handmadehero.org) created by [Casey Muratori](https://caseymuratori.com/about).
This project changed everything from me. I no longer needed to use a game engine to create my games,
because Casey show us all how to fill every pixel by hand.

Now, I am a subscriber of [Computer, Enhance!](https://www.computerenhance.com/), a video
substack by Casey on the low-level fundamentals of computers and performance-aware programming.
If you want to know why your code is slow, and how you can make it faster, this series is
for you.

That's all I have to say for now!
Happy coding.

\- Alex
